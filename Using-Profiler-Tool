# Using AVDTest

####### What it does
#
# AVDTest records the consumption and utilization of the phone as a whole
#   as well as the individual utilizations and frequencies of the 8 cores
#   while a target app runs in the forground.


####### Running Test
#
# Before running any tests, first make sure the phone is not charging and
#   to close any background apps, as while there contribution may be little, 
#we want to have consistent conditions for each test.
#
# After opening the AVDTest app, you may be prompted to allow root access.
#   choose "Remember choice for 10 minutes" then tap the Allow button. The app cannot
#   gather the data it needs without access to the root files.
#
# Select the app to be profiled from the list given then push the "Begin Test"
#   button. The selected app will then be opened to the foreground with a gray
#   "Start" button. 
#
# You can perform any actions needed to set up the app before testing now. If
#   the button is in the way, it can be moved by simply touching and dragging 
#   it to a different position.
#
# Once you are ready to start profiling, push the start button and the AVDTest
#   app will begin recording the different metrics on the phone, giving a realtime
#   read out of the current and the total cpu utilization.
#
# When the test is completed, push the button that now says "Stop" to save the
#   test files to internal storage
#
# The file name will be "EnergyProfiler_Result_XXXXYYYYZZZZZZZZ.csv" where 
#   X, Y, and Z are the year, the date, and the time respectively.
