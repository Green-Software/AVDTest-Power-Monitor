## Bootloader-and-Root-Access
#
# This file explains how to unlock the bootloader for Huawei P8
# as well as how to flash TWRP and SuperSU in order to get 
# root permissions



## Preconditions/Software required
#
# Check and make sure HiSuite is installed on the PC so the PC can communicate
# with the phone. 
# 
# Google ADB, which should include Fastboot, is also necessary. 
# 
# It is also a good idea to create a backup or have a clean image to reset the 
# phone if anything goes horribly wrong.



## Unlocking the Bootloader
#
# First, get the official code from Huawei to unlock your phone by going to:
#   
#   https://emui.huawei.com/en/plugin/unlock/index
#
# and fill out the form with the info from the "About phone" section of Settings
# (You may need to create an account and sign in first)
#
# Once you have the code, go to settings and enable developer options if they
# are not available by tapping the build number under the "About phone" section
# 6 times in quick succession. 
#
# In the developer options, enable USB debugging.
#
# After making usre all previous steps are done and the needed software is 
# installed on the PC, turn off the phone and then plug it into the PC via USB.
#
# On the PC, navigate to the folder containing ADB and open the command line.
#
# once in the terminal, execute the command
#   
#   adb reboot bootloader
#
# This will turn the phone on in bootloader mode. There should be an android 
# icon and the word "PHONE Locked" visible now.
#
# If that didn't work, try holding down the Volume down button and the power
# button on the phone simultaneously until the bootloader screen shows.
#
# Next, to unlock the bootloader, execute the command
#
#   fastboot oem unlock <your-unlock-code>
#
# where <your-unlock-code> is the 16-digit code from the Huawei site from before.
#
# After a short while the "PHONE Locked" should become a red "PHONE Unlocked"



## Flashing TWRP and setting up SuperSU
# 
# Now that the Bootloader is unlocked, we can flash on different boot environments.
#
# This way we can install third-party software that interacts directly with the 
# underlying linux code of Android.
#
# The most common and secure way to do this is with a boot environment called TWRP.
#
# First, download the most recent TWRP image for the Huawei phone from their website.
#
#   https://dl.twrp.me/p8/
# 
# Once the download is finished, move the file into the same folder as ADB
#
# rename the file to simply twrp.img.
#
# Then download a flashable .zip version of SuperSU from their website
#
#   http://www.supersu.com/download
#
# And move that into the internal memory of the phone using HiSuite.
#
# Now, reboot into the bootloader again, same as before.
#
# Once you are at the screen with the android icon, open the command line from
# the ADB folder. Then execute the command
#
#   fastboot flash recovery twrp.img
#
# and wait until it returns "Done". This temporarily sets the recovery boot mode
# to the TWRP boot environment. If you fail to boot into TWRP, you will need to
# repeat this process and flash TWRP again before attemping another reboot.
#
# Once TWRP is installed, unplug the phone from the PC.
#
# Then simultaneously hold down the Volume UP button and the Power button
# until the TeamWin logo shows up.
#
# Once in the TWRP screen, click the install button and find where you put
# the SuperSU .zip file. 
#
# finally, click on the file and then swipe the button on the bottom to 
# begin installing.
#
# After the installation is finished, you can simply trun the phone off and on 
# or pick "system" from the reboot options in TWRP.



## Using SuperSU
#
# Now that SuperSU is installed, any app that requires root permissions will
# query SuperSU and you can grant permission from the pop up that it gives.
